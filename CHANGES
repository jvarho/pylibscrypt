Release History

1.2.0
--
2014-5-16

Feature release:
- Support for the $7$ Modular Crypt Format that's been semi-standardized and 
  used by libsodium. (The $s1$ format remains the default.)
- Use libsodium 0.5+ pwhash as another fallback when parameters support it.
- More liberal in reading MCF hashes, so those from other implementations work.
- Fuzz testing of scrypt inputs.


1.1.3
--
2014-5-16

Bugfix release:
- Disallow null in MCF passwords, because that could result in a password that
  libscrypt can't verify.
- Verify MCF passwords with null even when using libscrypt to stay compatible
  with earlier releases.


1.1.2
--
2014-5-12

Bugfix release:
- Fix passwords longer than 256 bytes failing on python2


1.1.1
--
2014-5-12

Bugfix release:
- Fix some r and p values over/underflowing with libscrypt backend.
- Always check that r*p < 2**30.


1.1.0
--
2014-5-8

Feature release:
- On CPython libsodium is used for salsa20/8, for a 4x speedup when C scrypt
  is not available but libsodium is (optional).
- Tests have been converted to unittest. More readable and better coverage.


1.0.3
--
2014-5-5

Bugfix release:
- Guard against some libscrypt bugs found in older versions.
- Fix broken package import when libscrypt isn't available

Packaging fix


1.0.1
--
2014-5-3

Bugfix release:
- Enforced parameter requirements that libscrypt has for MCF form hashes.
  Initial release could accept parameters for scrypt_mcf that scrypt_mcf_check
  didn't support when using libscrypt backend.
- Fixed documentation and tests.
