1.2.0

TODO

Feature release:
- Support for the $7$ Modular Crypt Format that's been semi-standardized and 
  will be used by libsodium. (The $s1$ format remains the default.)
- Use libsodium 0.5+ pwhash as another fallback when parameters support it.
- More liberal in reading MCF hashes, so those from other implementations work.
- Fuzz testing of scrypt inputs.

Feature release:
- On cPython libsodium is used for salsa20/8, for a 4x speedup when C scrypt
  is not available but libsodium is (optional).
- Tests have been converted to unittest. More readable and more coverage.
